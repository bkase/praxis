## Reflection

1. Goal Achievement: Did you accomplish the specific goal you set at the start of the session? If not, why? Reflect on whether the goal was realistic, clear, or if distractions or other obstacles hindered progress.

2. Focus and Productivity: Assess how focused you were during the session. Were there moments when your attention wandered? Identify what caused distractions (e.g., external interruptions, mental fatigue) and how you can mitigate them in future sessions.

3. Time Management: Evaluate whether the time allocated for deep work was sufficient or excessive. Did you feel rushed, or did you have unused time? This helps fine-tune your scheduling for future sessions.

4. Energy Levels: Reflect on how your energy levels impacted your performance. Were you mentally or physically fatigued? Consider whether adjustments to your routine (e.g., breaks, nutrition, timing) could improve your energy for deep work.

5. Techniques and Tools: Review the effectiveness of any techniques or tools you used to enhance focus (e.g., playlists, workspace setup). Were they helpful, or could they be optimized?

6. Lessons Learned & Iteration: Note any insights gained about your work habits, strengths, or areas for improvement. For example, did a particular strategy help you stay in a flow state? Based on your reflections, identify specific changes or experiments to try in your next deep work session. This continuous iteration is key to building an effective system.

7. Alignment with Long-Term Goals: Reflect on whether the work done during the session aligns with your broader objectives or values. This ensures that your deep work contributes meaningfully to what matters most to you.
