## 1. Enhance Test Coverage with More Exhaustive Testing Patterns

Improve test coverage by adding integration tests for full user flows, using `withExhaustivity(.off)` for focused tests, adding snapshot tests for UI states, and following TCA testing best practices.

## 2. Add Performance Optimizations Using WithPerceptionTracking

Optimize app performance by adding `WithPerceptionTracking` for debugging observation issues, using `@ObservableState` more effectively, and optimizing child reducer scoping to minimize unnecessary view updates.
