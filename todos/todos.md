## 1. Loading spinner for AI analysis

The loading spinner isn't sufficient for such a long-running process -- we need to make the ux affordance better somehow.

## 2. Tighter Time Bounds

We should have a soft warning when the user passes their expected time and a larger one when they hit 1 hour. And we shouldn't let task estimation be shorter than 10min or longer than 45min when creating one.

## 3. AI Analysis Storage

A file should be created next to the reflection file with the results of the analysis that appear in the UI after the analysis step.
