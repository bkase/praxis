# Analysis Results

## Files Exceeding 200 Lines

Based on my analysis of the Momentum codebase, here are all the source files that exceed 200 lines:

### Swift Files:

1. **`/Users/bkase/Documents/momentum/todos/worktrees/2025-07-16-00-12-13-refactor-file-sizes/MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature.swift`**
   - **Line count: 460 lines**
   - **Contents**: The main TCA reducer for the app that manages the overall application state, navigation between different features (preparation, active session, reflection, analysis), error handling, and user interactions. This is the central orchestrator that coordinates all the different screens and flows in the app.

2. **`/Users/bkase/Documents/momentum/todos/worktrees/2025-07-16-00-12-13-refactor-file-sizes/MomentumApp/Sources/PreparationFeature.swift`**
   - **Line count: 238 lines**
   - **Contents**: The TCA reducer for the preparation screen where users set their goal and time. It manages the checklist functionality with animations, persistence of checklist state, and handles user interactions like starting sessions and toggling checklist items.

3. **`/Users/bkase/Documents/momentum/todos/worktrees/2025-07-16-00-12-13-refactor-file-sizes/MomentumApp/Tests/SessionManagementTests.swift`**
   - **Line count: 202 lines**
   - **Contents**: Test suite for session management functionality. Tests various scenarios including starting sessions, stopping sessions, handling errors, and managing state transitions between different app states.

### Rust Files:

4. **`/Users/bkase/Documents/momentum/todos/worktrees/2025-07-16-00-12-13-refactor-file-sizes/momentum/src/tests.rs`**
   - **Line count: 313 lines**
   - **Contents**: Comprehensive test suite for the Rust CLI. Contains mock implementations of file system, clock, and API client dependencies, along with unit tests for all the main CLI commands (start, stop, analyze) and error handling scenarios.

## Summary

There are 4 source files that exceed the 200-line limit specified in the project's coding standards. According to the CLAUDE.md file, these files should be refactored into multiple smaller files to improve readability, maintainability, and make code reviews easier. The largest file is `AppFeature.swift` with 460 lines, followed by `tests.rs` with 313 lines.

## Analysis of Momentum Codebase Structure

Based on my analysis of the Momentum codebase, here are the key patterns and findings:

### Current Organization Patterns

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - **Dependencies/**: Contains TCA dependency implementations (RustCoreClient, DateGenerator, ProcessHelpers, etc.)
   - **Models/**: Domain models and data structures (SessionModels, RustCoreModels, Goal, Minutes, etc.)
   - **Views/**: UI components with a Components/ subdirectory for reusable views
   - **Styles/**: Custom SwiftUI view styles
   - **Extensions/**: Swift type extensions
   - **Features**: Feature-specific reducers at the root level (AppFeature, PreparationFeature, etc.)

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Features: `[Name]Feature.swift` (e.g., AppFeature, PreparationFeature, ActiveSessionFeature)
   - Views: `[Name]View.swift` (e.g., PreparationView, ActiveSessionView)
   - Models: Domain-specific names (e.g., Goal.swift, Minutes.swift)
   - Dependencies: `[Name]Client.swift` or descriptive names (e.g., RustCoreClient, ChecklistClient)
   - Tests: `[Feature]Tests.swift` (e.g., SessionManagementTests, ChecklistTests)

3. **File Size Findings**:
   - **Files exceeding 200 lines**:
     - `AppFeature.swift`: 460 lines ⚠️
     - `PreparationFeature.swift`: 238 lines ⚠️
     - `SessionManagementTests.swift`: 202 lines ⚠️
     - `tests.rs` (Rust): 313 lines ⚠️
   - Most other files are well under 200 lines

4. **Modularization Patterns**:
   - **Swift/TCA**: 
     - Separates reducers (Features), views, models, and dependencies
     - Uses nested Destination reducers for navigation
     - Extracts reusable UI components into Views/Components/
     - Dependency injection via TCA's dependency system
   - **Rust**:
     - Clean module separation: action, state, update, effects, models, environment
     - Each module has a focused responsibility
     - Tests are in a separate module

5. **Best Practices Observed**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Dependency injection for testability
   - Reusable components extracted appropriately
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Good use of subdirectories for organization

### Recommendations for Refactoring Large Files

1. **AppFeature.swift (460 lines)** could be split into:
   - `AppFeature+Core.swift`: Main reducer logic
   - `AppFeature+Navigation.swift`: Destination handling
   - `AppFeature+Effects.swift`: Side effects and actions
   - `AppFeature+State.swift`: State and related types

2. **PreparationFeature.swift (238 lines)** could be split into:
   - `PreparationFeature+Core.swift`: Main reducer
   - `PreparationFeature+Checklist.swift`: Checklist-specific logic
   - `PreparationFeature+Models.swift`: Local state types

3. **tests.rs (313 lines)** could be split into:
   - `tests/start_tests.rs`: Start command tests
   - `tests/stop_tests.rs`: Stop command tests
   - `tests/analyze_tests.rs`: Analyze command tests
   - `tests/helpers.rs`: Test utilities

The codebase shows good organization overall, with just a few files needing refactoring to meet the 200-line limit.
