# Auto-formatting

**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 86816

## Original Todo

We need to introduce targets for auto-formatting in the Makefile. Then we need to use the Swift format for Swift and cargo format for Rust. Our Makefile targets should follow the same pattern as the other ones. Our CI job should enforce that this is working in the lint job. We can refactor the existing lint job into like a Clippy. The lint should be both a format check and in the Clippy. Let's update the todos/project-description.md and also the CLAUDE.md so that we know about this make format. We can be smart about doing it every time we do a task.

## Description

We're adding comprehensive auto-formatting capabilities to the Momentum project for both Swift and Rust code. This includes:
- Creating new Makefile targets for formatting Swift and Rust code
- Installing and configuring SwiftFormat for Swift code formatting
- Leveraging the existing cargo fmt for Rust code formatting  
- Updating the CI pipeline to enforce formatting standards
- Updating documentation to reflect the new formatting commands
- Creating a `.swiftformat` configuration file to maintain the project's existing code style

The goal is to ensure consistent code formatting across the entire codebase and make it easy for contributors to format their code before committing.

## Implementation Plan

Here's how we'll implement auto-formatting for the Momentum project:

- [ ] Create .swiftformat configuration file with project-specific rules (/.swiftformat)
- [ ] Add swiftformat to mise configuration (.mise.toml or .tool-versions)
- [ ] Add rust-format target to Makefile that runs `cargo fmt`
- [ ] Add swift-format target to Makefile that runs `swiftformat .`
- [ ] Add combined format target to Makefile that runs both rust-format and swift-format
- [ ] Update rust-lint target to separate formatting check from clippy
- [ ] Create swift-lint target that runs `swiftformat --lint .`
- [ ] Update lint target to include both rust-lint and swift-lint
- [ ] Update CI workflow to run the new lint target that checks both formatters
- [ ] Format entire codebase with new formatters and commit changes
- [ ] Update todos/project-description.md to include new format command
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to mention auto-formatting during tasks
- [ ] Automated test: Run `make format` and verify no errors
- [ ] User test: Run `make lint` and verify formatting is checked

## Notes

- SwiftFormat was successfully integrated using mise package manager
- Created minimal .swiftformat configuration to preserve existing code style
- Added automatic fix for Tuist-generated files that lack trailing newlines
- CI now enforces both Rust and Swift formatting standards
- All existing code was formatted with minimal changes (mostly adding newlines)
