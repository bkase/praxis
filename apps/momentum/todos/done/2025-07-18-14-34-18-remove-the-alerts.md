# Remove the alerts
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 7871

## Original Todo
Alert modals are lazy design. All errors should be presented inline, and we don't need "are you sure" dialogs, just do it.

## Description
Replace all alert modals and confirmation dialogs with inline error messages and direct actions. This includes removing error alerts, the "stop session" confirmation, and the "reset app" confirmation. All errors will be displayed inline within the relevant views, and confirmation actions will execute immediately without dialogs.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Remove alert state and confirmation dialog state from AppFeature+State.swift
- [x] Remove alert presentation modifier from ContentView.swift
- [x] Add error state properties to each feature (Preparation, ActiveSession, Reflection, Analysis)
- [x] Remove all alert-related actions and cases from AppFeature.swift
- [x] Update error handling to set feature-specific error states instead of alerts
- [x] Add inline error display UI to each view (following PreparationView pattern)
- [x] Remove confirmation dialogs - make stop session and reset immediate actions
- [x] Update tests to check for inline errors instead of alerts
- [x] Remove AppFeature+Navigation.swift alert factory methods
- [x] Add smart error dismissal: validation errors persist until fixed, operation errors auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- [x] Style errors consistently using red text below relevant UI elements
- [x] Fix failing tests to match new inline error behavior with auto-dismissal

## Summary of Completed Work

Successfully removed all alerts and confirmation dialogs from the Momentum app:

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
1. **Removed alert state and confirmation dialog state from AppFeature+State.swift**
2. **Removed alert presentation modifier from ContentView.swift**
3. **Added error state properties to each feature** (operationError: String?)
4. **Removed all alert-related actions and cases from AppFeature.swift**
5. **Updated error handling to set feature-specific error states**
6. **Added inline error display UI to each view** (consistent red text below buttons)
7. **Removed confirmation dialogs** - stop session and reset now happen immediately
8. **Updated tests to check for inline errors** - all tests now pass ✅
9. **Removed AppFeature+Navigation.swift** and moved Destination enum to AppFeature.swift
10. **Added smart error dismissal logic**:
    - Validation errors persist until fixed
    - Operation errors auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
    - Errors clear when users type in inputs
11. **Styled errors consistently** using red text below relevant UI elements
12. **Fixed all failing tests** to match new inline error behavior with auto-dismissal
13. **Added error logging** for debugging with OSLog
14. **Added `make tail-logs` command** to tail app logs in real-time
15. **Refactored error UI** into reusable `OperationErrorView` component

### What Was Changed:
- All error alerts now display inline below the relevant UI element
- Stop session happens immediately without confirmation
- Reset happens immediately without confirmation
- Errors auto-dismiss after 5 seconds for transient issues
- Errors clear when users interact with inputs
- Errors are logged to console for debugging
- Eliminated code duplication with reusable error component

### Final Result:
All implementation is complete and all tests pass. The app now provides a cleaner, more modern user experience without disruptive modal alerts.
