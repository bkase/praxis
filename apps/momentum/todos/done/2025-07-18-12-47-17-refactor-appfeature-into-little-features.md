## Original Todo
## 3. Refactor the AppFeature into little features

Read @todos/plan3.md for more details

## Description
Refactor AppFeature from a centralized orchestrator into a pure coordinator by implementing the Delegate Action Pattern. Transform child features (PreparationFeature, ActiveSessionFeature, ReflectionFeature, AnalysisFeature) into autonomous, self-contained modules that own their business logic and side effects. This will improve modularity, testability, and separation of concerns by having AppFeature focus solely on navigation and high-level application flow.

## Implementation Plan
**Phase 1: Refactor `start` logic into PreparationFeature**
- [x] Add delegate action enum to PreparationFeature with .sessionStarted(SessionData) and .sessionFailedToStart(AppError) cases (MomentumApp/Sources/PreparationFeature.swift)
- [x] Define RustCoreError enum in MomentumApp/Sources/Models/
- [x] Add @Dependency(\.rustCoreClient) to PreparationFeature and move start session effect logic from AppFeature (MomentumApp/Sources/PreparationFeature.swift)
- [x] Update AppFeature to handle .destination(.presented(.preparation(.delegate(...)))) actions instead of .startSession (MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature.swift)
- [x] Remove obsolete start-related actions from AppFeature.Action (MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature+State.swift)
- [x] Create PreparationFeatureTests.swift to test start session flow with mocked rustCoreClient
- [x] Update SessionManagementTests to test coordination via delegate actions instead of direct effects
- [x] Fix ErrorHandlingTests.swift and FullFlowTests.swift to use the new delegate pattern
- [x] User test: Start a new session and verify it works as before

**Phase 2: Refactor `stop` logic into ActiveSessionFeature**
- [x] Add delegate action enum to ActiveSessionFeature with .sessionStopped(reflectionPath: String) and .sessionFailedToStop(AppError) cases (MomentumApp/Sources/ActiveSessionFeature.swift)
- [x] Add @Dependency(\.rustCoreClient) to ActiveSessionFeature and move stop session effect logic from AppFeature (MomentumApp/Sources/ActiveSessionFeature.swift)
- [x] Update AppFeature to handle .destination(.presented(.activeSession(.delegate(...)))) actions (MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature.swift)
- [x] Remove obsolete stop-related actions from AppFeature.Action (MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature+State.swift)
- [x] Create ActiveSessionFeatureTests.swift to test stop session flow
- [x] Update SessionManagementTests for stop functionality
- [x] User test: Stop an active session and verify reflection file is created

**Phase 3: Refactor `analyze` logic into ReflectionFeature**
- [x] Add delegate action enum to ReflectionFeature with .analysisRequested(analysisResult: AnalysisResult) and .analysisFailedToStart(AppError) cases (MomentumApp/Sources/ReflectionFeature.swift)
- [x] Add @Dependency(\.rustCoreClient) to ReflectionFeature and move analyze effect logic from AppFeature (MomentumApp/Sources/ReflectionFeature.swift)
- [x] Update AppFeature to handle .destination(.presented(.reflection(.delegate(...)))) actions (MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature.swift)
- [x] Remove obsolete analyze-related actions from AppFeature.Action (MomentumApp/Sources/AppFeature+State.swift)
- [x] Create ReflectionFeatureTests.swift to test analyze flow
- [x] Update relevant AppFeature tests
- [x] User test: Complete a reflection and analyze it to see results

**Phase 4: Project restructuring and cleanup**
- [x] Create Features/ directory structure and move files: Preparation/, ActiveSession/, Reflection/, Analysis/ (MomentumApp/Sources/Features/)
- [x] Run tuist generate to update Xcode project with new file structure
- [x] Review and minimize AppFeature+Effects.swift - should only contain app launch session check [No Effects file exists, AppFeature is already clean]
- [x] Clean up AppFeature.swift to be a simple state machine responding to delegate actions [Already clean]
- [x] Delete all obsolete action cases from AppFeature.Action [No obsolete actions found]
- [x] Run all tests to ensure nothing broke: `xcodebuild -workspace Momentum.xcworkspace -scheme MomentumApp test -skipMacroValidation`
- [x] Build the app: `xcodebuild -workspace Momentum.xcworkspace -scheme MomentumApp build -skipMacroValidation`
