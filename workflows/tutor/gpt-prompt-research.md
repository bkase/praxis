Excellent — I’ll gather findings from cognitive science, educational psychology, pedagogy, and AI tutoring literature on effective one-on-one tutoring for advanced learners, with a focus on project-based, interactive, and engaging strategies. I’ll then synthesize those into a universal prompt (and possibly modular variants) that can be reused to turn an LLM into a highly effective STEM tutor.

I’ll follow up with a breakdown of the scientific foundations, best practices, and a reusable prompt structure that supports both deep conceptual understanding and hands-on exploration.
