# Weekly Reflection Questions (v2) — Scoreboard → Principles → Adjustments

## Layer 0 (core; short answers)
1) Floors (A–F): which did I meet? which broke first? why?
2) Deep work: how many 2h+ blocks happened? what prevented the rest?
3) Proof: what shipped? (Project 1 ships; Project 2 ships)
4) Pride (1–5) + Wonder (1–5): what drove each?
5) Remove one thing next week (drop, delegate, defer).

## Layer 1 (recommended)
6) Principles check:
   - Balance: did the *week* feel nourished (even if some days weren’t)?
   - Momentum: what early actions worked? what mornings got hijacked?
   - Wonder: did wonder stay bounded or steal from the other 3?
   - Excellence: when did I strive for excellence? what conditions helped?

7) Excellence notes (pattern mining):
   - What made excellence easier?
   - What made excellence harder?
   - One quality move I want to repeat next week.

8) Avoidance / discomfort:
   - Where did I avoid a hard conversation/task?
   - What’s one discomfort rep next week?

## Layer 2 (optional)
9) Stacking: which stacks created overlap (people/health/building/reflection)? which stacks failed?
10) What experiment do I want to run next week to reduce friction?
11) Any meaningful social encounters or “challenge moments” worth designing more of?
